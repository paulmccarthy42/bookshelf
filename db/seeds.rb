  I. THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD

April is the cruellest month, breeding
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
Memory and desire, stirring
Dull roots with spring rain.
Winter kept us warm, covering
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
A little life with dried tubers.
Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,                            10
And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
Bin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
And when we were children, staying at the archduke’s,
My cousin’s, he took me out on a sled,
And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
In the mountains, there you feel free.
I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow
Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,                                  20
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,
And the dry stone no sound of water. Only
There is shadow under this red rock,
(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),
And I will show you something different from either
Your shadow at morning striding behind you
Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;
I will show you fear in a handful of dust.                              30
   _Frisch weht der Wind
   Der Heimat zu
   Mein Irisch Kind,
   Wo weilest du?_
“You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;
“They called me the hyacinth girl.”
—Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,
Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not
Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither
Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,                                    40
Looking into the heart of light, the silence.
_Oed’ und leer das Meer_.

Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,
Had a bad cold, nevertheless
Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe,
With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she,
Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor,
(Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!)
Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks,
The lady of situations.                                                 50
Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel,
And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card,
Which is blank, is something he carries on his back,
Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find
The Hanged Man. Fear death by water.
I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring.
Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,
Tell her I bring the horoscope myself:
One must be so careful these days.

Unreal City,                                                            60
Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,
A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,
I had not thought death had undone so many.
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.
Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,
To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours
With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.
There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying “Stetson!
“You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!                            70
“That corpse you planted last year in your garden,
“Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?
“Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?
“Oh keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men,
“Or with his nails he’ll dig it up again!
“You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!”    
  


  
    

  



  II. A GAME OF CHESS

The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne,
Glowed on the marble, where the glass
Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines
From which a golden Cupidon peeped out                                  80
(Another hid his eyes behind his wing)
Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra
Reflecting light upon the table as
The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it,
From satin cases poured in rich profusion.
In vials of ivory and coloured glass
Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes,
Unguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused
And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air
That freshened from the window, these ascended                          90
In fattening the prolonged candle-flames,
Flung their smoke into the laquearia,
Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling.
Huge sea-wood fed with copper
Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone,
In which sad light a carvèd dolphin swam.
Above the antique mantel was displayed
As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene
The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king
So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale                             100
Filled all the desert with inviolable voice
And still she cried, and still the world pursues,
“Jug Jug” to dirty ears.
And other withered stumps of time
Were told upon the walls; staring forms
Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.
Footsteps shuffled on the stair.
Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair
Spread out in fiery points
Glowed into words, then would be savagely still.                        110

“My nerves are bad to-night. Yes, bad. Stay with me.
“Speak to me. Why do you never speak. Speak.
“What are you thinking of? What thinking? What?
“I never know what you are thinking. Think.”

I think we are in rats’ alley
Where the dead men lost their bones.

“What is that noise?”
                           The wind under the door.
“What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?”
                           Nothing again nothing.                     120
                                                                “Do
“You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember
“Nothing?”

 I remember
Those are pearls that were his eyes.
“Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?”
                                                                  But
O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag—
It’s so elegant
So intelligent                                                          130
“What shall I do now? What shall I do?”
I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street
“With my hair down, so. What shall we do tomorrow?
“What shall we ever do?”
                                   The hot water at ten.
And if it rains, a closed car at four.
And we shall play a game of chess,
Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door.

When Lil’s husband got demobbed, I said—
I didn’t mince my words, I said to her myself,                          140
HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME
Now Albert’s coming back, make yourself a bit smart.
He’ll want to know what you done with that money he gave you
To get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there.
You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set,
He said, I swear, I can’t bear to look at you.
And no more can’t I, I said, and think of poor Albert,
He’s been in the army four years, he wants a good time,
And if you don’t give it him, there’s others will, I said.
Oh is there, she said. Something o’ that, I said.                       150
Then I’ll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look.
HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME
If you don’t like it you can get on with it, I said.
Others can pick and choose if you can’t.
But if Albert makes off, it won’t be for lack of telling.
You ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique.
(And her only thirty-one.)
I can’t help it, she said, pulling a long face,
It’s them pills I took, to bring it off, she said.
(She’s had five already, and nearly died of young George.)              160
The chemist said it would be all right, but I’ve never been the same.
You _are_ a proper fool, I said.
Well, if Albert won’t leave you alone, there it is, I said,
What you get married for if you don’t want children?
HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME
Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon,
And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot—
HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME
HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME
Goonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight.                    170
Ta ta. Goonight. Goonight.
Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.    
  


  
    

  



  III. THE FIRE SERMON

The river’s tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf
Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind
Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.
The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,
Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends
Or other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed.
And their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors;               180
Departed, have left no addresses.
By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept . . .
Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song,
Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long.
But at my back in a cold blast I hear
The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.
A rat crept softly through the vegetation
Dragging its slimy belly on the bank
While I was fishing in the dull canal
On a winter evening round behind the gashouse                           190
Musing upon the king my brother’s wreck
And on the king my father’s death before him.
White bodies naked on the low damp ground
And bones cast in a little low dry garret,
Rattled by the rat’s foot only, year to year.
But at my back from time to time I hear
The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring
Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.
O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter
And on her daughter                                                     200
They wash their feet in soda water
_Et O ces voix d’enfants, chantant dans la coupole!_

Twit twit twit
Jug jug jug jug jug jug
So rudely forc’d.
Tereu

Unreal City
Under the brown fog of a winter noon
Mr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant
Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants                                210
C.i.f. London: documents at sight,
Asked me in demotic French
To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel
Followed by a weekend at the Metropole.

At the violet hour, when the eyes and back
Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits
Like a taxi throbbing waiting,
I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives,
Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see
At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives                       220
Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea,
The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights
Her stove, and lays out food in tins.
Out of the window perilously spread
Her drying combinations touched by the sun’s last rays,
On the divan are piled (at night her bed)
Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays.
I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs
Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest—
I too awaited the expected guest.                                       230
He, the young man carbuncular, arrives,
A small house agent’s clerk, with one bold stare,
One of the low on whom assurance sits
As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire.
The time is now propitious, as he guesses,
The meal is ended, she is bored and tired,
Endeavours to engage her in caresses
Which still are unreproved, if undesired.
Flushed and decided, he assaults at once;
Exploring hands encounter no defence;                                   240
His vanity requires no response,
And makes a welcome of indifference.
(And I Tiresias have foresuffered all
Enacted on this same divan or bed;
I who have sat by Thebes below the wall
And walked among the lowest of the dead.)
Bestows one final patronising kiss,
And gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit . . .

She turns and looks a moment in the glass,
Hardly aware of her departed lover;                                     250
Her brain allows one half-formed thought to pass:
“Well now that’s done: and I’m glad it’s over.”
When lovely woman stoops to folly and
Paces about her room again, alone,
She smooths her hair with automatic hand,
And puts a record on the gramophone.

“This music crept by me upon the waters”
And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street.
O City city, I can sometimes hear
Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street,                             260
The pleasant whining of a mandoline
And a clatter and a chatter from within
Where fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls
Of Magnus Martyr hold
Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.

   The river sweats
   Oil and tar
   The barges drift
   With the turning tide
   Red sails                                                          270
   Wide
   To leeward, swing on the heavy spar.
   The barges wash
   Drifting logs
   Down Greenwich reach
   Past the Isle of Dogs.
        Weialala leia
        Wallala leialala
   Elizabeth and Leicester
   Beating oars                                                       280
   The stern was formed
   A gilded shell
   Red and gold
   The brisk swell
   Rippled both shores
   Southwest wind
   Carried down stream
   The peal of bells
   White towers
        Weialala leia                                                 290

“Trams and dusty trees.
Highbury bore me. Richmond and Kew
Undid me. By Richmond I raised my knees
Supine on the floor of a narrow canoe.”

“My feet are at Moorgate, and my heart
Under my feet. After the event
He wept. He promised ‘a new start’.
I made no comment. What should I resent?”
“On Margate Sands.                                                      300
I can connect
Nothing with nothing.
The broken fingernails of dirty hands.
My people humble people who expect
Nothing.”

To Carthage then I came

  IV. DEATH BY WATER

Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,
Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell
And the profit and loss.
                                       A current under sea
Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell
He passed the stages of his age and youth
Entering the whirlpool.
                                     Gentile or Jew
O you who turn the wheel and look to windward,                          320
Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you.    
  


  
    

  



  V. WHAT THE THUNDER SAID

After the torchlight red on sweaty faces
After the frosty silence in the gardens
After the agony in stony places
The shouting and the crying
Prison and palace and reverberation
Of thunder of spring over distant mountains
He who was living is now dead
We who were living are now dying
With a little patience                                                  330

Here is no water but only rock
Rock and no water and the sandy road
The road winding above among the mountains
Which are mountains of rock without water
If there were water we should stop and drink
Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think
Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand
If there were only water amongst the rock
Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit
Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit                              340
There is not even silence in the mountains
But dry sterile thunder without rain
There is not even solitude in the mountains
But red sullen faces sneer and snarl
From doors of mudcracked houses
                                                       If there were water
And no rock
If there were rock
And also water
And water                                                               350
A spring
A pool among the rock
If there were the sound of water only
Not the cicada
And dry grass singing
But sound of water over a rock
Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees
Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop
But there is no water

Who is the third who walks always beside you?
When I count, there are only you and I together                         360
But when I look ahead up the white road
There is always another one walking beside you
Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded
I do not know whether a man or a woman
—But who is that on the other side of you?

What is that sound high in the air
Murmur of maternal lamentation
Who are those hooded hordes swarming
Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth
Ringed by the flat horizon only                                         370
What is the city over the mountains
Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air
Falling towers
Jerusalem Athens Alexandria
Vienna London
Unreal

A woman drew her long black hair out tight
And fiddled whisper music on those strings
And bats with baby faces in the violet light
Whistled, and beat their wings                                          380
And crawled head downward down a blackened wall
And upside down in air were towers
Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours
And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.

In this decayed hole among the mountains
In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing
Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel
There is the empty chapel, only the wind’s home.
It has no windows, and the door swings,
Dry bones can harm no one.                                              390
Only a cock stood on the rooftree
Co co rico co co rico
In a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust
Bringing rain

Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves
Waited for rain, while the black clouds
Gathered far distant, over Himavant.
The jungle crouched, humped in silence.
Then spoke the thunder
DA                                                                      400
_Datta:_ what have we given?
My friend, blood shaking my heart
The awful daring of a moment’s surrender
Which an age of prudence can never retract
By this, and this only, we have existed
Which is not to be found in our obituaries
Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider
Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor
In our empty rooms
DA                                                                      410
_Dayadhvam:_ I have heard the key
Turn in the door once and turn once only
We think of the key, each in his prison
Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison
Only at nightfall, aetherial rumours
Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus
DA
_Damyata:_ The boat responded
Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar
The sea was calm, your heart would have responded                       420
Gaily, when invited, beating obedient
To controlling hands

                                   I sat upon the shore
Fishing, with the arid plain behind me
Shall I at least set my lands in order?
London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down
_Poi s’ascose nel foco che gli affina
Quando fiam ceu chelidon_ — O swallow swallow
_Le Prince d’Aquitaine à la tour abolie_
These fragments I have shored against my ruins                          430
Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo’s mad againe.
Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata.

  NOTES ON “THE WASTE LAND”

  Not only the title, but the plan and a good deal of the
  incidental symbolism of the poem were suggested by Miss Jessie L.
  Weston’s book on the Grail legend: _From Ritual to Romance_
  (Macmillan, Cambridge) Indeed, so deeply am I indebted, Miss
  Weston’s book will elucidate the difficulties of the poem much
  better than my notes can do; and I recommend it (apart from the
  great interest of the book itself) to any who think such
  elucidation of the poem worth the trouble. To another work of
  anthropology I am indebted in general, one which has influenced
  our generation profoundly; I mean _The Golden Bough_; I have used
  especially the two volumes _Adonis, Attis, Osiris_. Anyone who is
  acquainted with these works will immediately recognise in the
  poem certain references to vegetation ceremonies.

  I. THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD

  Line 20.  Cf.  _Ezekiel_ 2:1.

  23.  Cf.  _Ecclesiastes_ 12:5.

  31.  V.  _Tristan und Isolde_, i, verses 5-8.

  42.  Id.  iii, verse 24.

  46.  I am not familiar with the exact constitution of the Tarot
  pack of cards, from which I have obviously departed to suit my
  own convenience. The Hanged Man, a member of the traditional
  pack, fits my purpose in two ways:  because he is associated in
  my mind with the Hanged God of Frazer, and because I associate
  him with the hooded figure in the passage of the disciples to
  Emmaus in Part V. The Phoenician Sailor and the Merchant appear
  later; also the “crowds of people,” and Death by Water is
  executed in Part IV.  The Man with Three Staves (an authentic
  member of the Tarot pack) I associate, quite arbitrarily, with
  the Fisher King himself.

  60.  Cf.  Baudelaire:


   “Fourmillante cité, cité; pleine de rêves,
   Où le spectre en plein jour raccroche le passant.”    
  63.  Cf.  _Inferno_, iii.  55-7.


                                 “si lunga tratta
   di gente, ch’io non avrei mai creduto
   che morte tanta n’avesse disfatta.”    
  64.  Cf.  _Inferno_, iv.  25-7:


   “Quivi, secondo che per ascoltare,
   “non avea pianto, ma’ che di sospiri,
   “che l’aura eterna facevan tremare.”    
  68.  A phenomenon which I have often noticed.

  74.  Cf.  the Dirge in Webster’s _White Devil_.

  76.  V. Baudelaire, Preface to _Fleurs du Mal_.

  II.  A GAME OF CHESS

  77.  Cf.  _Antony and Cleopatra_, II. ii., l. 190.

  92.  Laquearia.  V.  _Aeneid_, I. 726:


   dependent lychni laquearibus aureis

  210.  “Carriage and insurance free”] “cost, insurance and
  freight”-Editor.

  218.  Tiresias, although a mere spectator and not indeed a
  “character,” is yet the most important personage in the poem,
  uniting all the rest. Just as the one-eyed merchant, seller of
  currants, melts into the Phoenician Sailor, and the latter is not
  wholly distinct from Ferdinand Prince of Naples, so all the women
  are one woman, and the two sexes meet in Tiresias.  What Tiresias
  _sees_, in fact, is the substance of the poem.  The whole passage
  from Ovid is of great anthropological interest:


   ‘. . . Cum Iunone iocos et maior vestra profecto est
   Quam, quae contingit maribus,’ dixisse, ‘voluptas.’
   Illa negat; placuit quae sit sententia docti
   Quaerere Tiresiae: venus huic erat utraque nota.
   Nam duo magnorum viridi coeuntia silva
   Corpora serpentum baculi violaverat ictu
   Deque viro factus, mirabile, femina septem
   Egerat autumnos; octavo rursus eosdem
   Vidit et ‘est vestrae si tanta potentia plagae,’
   Dixit ‘ut auctoris sortem in contraria mutet,
   Nunc quoque vos feriam!’ percussis anguibus isdem
   Forma prior rediit genetivaque venit imago.
   Arbiter hic igitur sumptus de lite iocosa
   Dicta Iovis firmat; gravius Saturnia iusto
   Nec pro materia fertur doluisse suique
   Iudicis aeterna damnavit lumina nocte,
   At pater omnipotens (neque enim licet inrita cuiquam
   Facta dei fecisse deo) pro lumine adempto
   Scire futura dedit poenamque levavit honore.    

  221.  This may not appear as exact as Sappho’s lines, but I had
  in mind the “longshore” or “dory” fisherman, who returns at
  nightfall.

  “In the afternoon we were in a barge, watching the games on the
  river. (The queen) was alone with Lord Robert and myself on the
  poop, when they began to talk nonsense, and went so far that Lord
  Robert at last said, as I was on the spot there was no reason why
  they should not be married if the queen pleased.”

  293.  Cf.  _Purgatorio_, v.  133:


   “Ricorditi di me, che son la Pia;
   Siena mi fe’, disfecemi Maremma.”    
  
  307.  V. St. Augustine’s _Confessions_:  “to Carthage then I
  came, where a cauldron of unholy loves sang all about mine ears.”

  308.  The complete text of the Buddha’s Fire Sermon (which
  corresponds in importance to the Sermon on the Mount) from which
  these words are taken, will be found translated in the late Henry
  Clarke Warren’s _Buddhism in Translation_ (Harvard Oriental
  Series). Mr. Warren was one of the great pioneers of Buddhist
  studies in the Occident.

  309.  From St. Augustine’s _Confessions_ again.  The collocation
  of these two representatives of eastern and western asceticism,
  as the culmination of this part of the poem, is not an accident.

  V. WHAT THE THUNDER SAID

  In the first part of Part V three themes are employed:
  the journey to Emmaus, the approach to the Chapel Perilous
  (see Miss Weston’s book) and the present decay of eastern Europe.

  357.  This is _Turdus aonalaschkae pallasii_, the hermit-thrush
  which I have heard in Quebec County.  Chapman says (_Handbook of
  Birds of Eastern North America_) “it is most at home in secluded
  woodland and thickety retreats. . . . Its notes are not
  remarkable for variety or volume, but in purity and sweetness of
  tone and exquisite modulation they are unequalled.”  Its
  “water-dripping song” is justly celebrated.

  360.  The following lines were stimulated by the account of one
  of the Antarctic expeditions (I forget which, but I think one
  of Shackleton’s): it was related that the party of explorers,
  at the extremity of their strength, had the constant delusion
  that there was _one more member_ than could actually be counted.

  366-76. Cf.  Hermann Hesse, _Blick ins Chaos_:

  “Schon ist halb Europa, schon ist zumindest der halbe Osten
  Europas auf dem Wege zum Chaos, fährt betrunken im heiligem Wahn
  am Abgrund entlang und singt dazu, singt betrunken und hymnisch
  wie Dmitri Karamasoff sang. Ueber diese Lieder lacht der Bürger
  beleidigt, der Heilige und Seher hört sie mit Tränen.”

  401.  “Datta, dayadhvam, damyata” (Give, sympathize,
  control). The fable of the meaning of the Thunder is found
  in the _Brihadaranyaka—Upanishad_, 5, 1.  A translation is found
  in Deussen’s _Sechzig Upanishads des Veda_, p.  489.

  407.  Cf.  Webster, _The White Devil_, v.  vi:


                                                  “. . . they’ll remarry
 Ere the worm pierce your winding-sheet, ere the spider
 Make a thin curtain for your epitaphs.”    
  411.  Cf.  _Inferno_, xxxiii.  46:


        “ed io sentii chiavar l’uscio di sotto
        all’orribile torre.”    
  Also F. H. Bradley, _Appearance and Reality_, p.  346:

  “My external sensations are no less private to myself than are my
  thoughts or my feelings.  In either case my experience falls
  within my own circle, a circle closed on the outside; and, with
  all its elements alike, every sphere is opaque to the others
  which surround it. . . . In brief, regarded as an existence which
  appears in a soul, the whole world for each is peculiar and
  private to that soul.”

  424.  V. Weston, From _Ritual to Romance_; chapter on the Fisher
  King.

  427.  V.  _Purgatorio_, xxvi.  148.


        “‘Ara vos prec per aquella valor
         ‘que vos guida al som de l’escalina,
         ‘sovegna vos a temps de ma dolor.’
          Poi s’ascose nel foco che gli affina.”

INTRODUCTION

   Piping down the valleys wild,
     Piping songs of pleasant glee,
   On a cloud I saw a child,
     And he laughing said to me:
   \"Pipe a song about a Lamb!\"
     So I piped with merry cheer.
   \"Piper, pipe that song again;\"
     So I piped: he wept to hear.
   \"Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;
     Sing thy songs of happy cheer!\"
   So I sang the same again,
     While he wept with joy to hear.
   \"Piper, sit thee down and write
     In a book, that all may read.\"
   So he vanish'd from my sight;
     And I pluck'd a hollow reed,
   And I made a rural pen,
     And I stain'd the water clear,
   And I wrote my happy songs
     Every child may joy to hear.
THE SHEPHERD

   How sweet is the Shepherd's sweet lot!
   From the morn to the evening he stays;
   He shall follow his sheep all the day,
   And his tongue shall be filled with praise.
   For he hears the lambs' innocent call,
   And he hears the ewes' tender reply;
   He is watching while they are in peace,
   For they know when their Shepherd is nigh.
THE ECHOING GREEN

   The sun does arise,
   And make happy the skies;
   The merry bells ring
   To welcome the Spring;
   The skylark and thrush,
   The birds of the bush,
   Sing louder around
   To the bells' cheerful sound;
   While our sports shall be seen
   On the echoing Green.
   Old John, with white hair,
   Does laugh away care,
   Sitting under the oak,
   Among the old folk.
   They laugh at our play,
   And soon they all say,
   \"Such, such were the joys
   When we all—girls and boys—
   In our youth-time were seen
   On the echoing Green.\"
   Till the little ones, weary,
   No more can be merry:
   The sun does descend,
   And our sports have an end.
   Round the laps of their mothers
   Many sisters and brothers,
   Like birds in their nest,
   Are ready for rest,
   And sport no more seen
   On the darkening green.
THE LAMB

     Little Lamb, who made thee
     Dost thou know who made thee,
   Gave thee life, and bid thee feed
   By the stream and o'er the mead;
   Gave thee clothing of delight,
   Softest clothing, woolly, bright;
   Gave thee such a tender voice,
   Making all the vales rejoice?
     Little Lamb, who made thee?
     Dost thou know who made thee?
     Little Lamb, I'll tell thee;
     Little Lamb, I'll tell thee:
   He is called by thy name,
   For He calls Himself a Lamb
   He is meek, and He is mild,
   He became a little child.
   I a child, and thou a lamb,
   We are called by His name.
     Little Lamb, God bless thee!
     Little Lamb, God bless thee!
THE LITTLE BLACK BOY

   My mother bore me in the southern wild,
     And I am black, but oh my soul is white!
   White as an angel is the English child,
     But I am black, as if bereaved of light.
   My mother taught me underneath a tree,
     And, sitting down before the heat of day,
   She took me on her lap and kissed me,
     And, pointed to the east, began to say:
   \"Look on the rising sun: there God does live,
     And gives His light, and gives His heat away,
   And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive
     Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday.
   \"And we are put on earth a little space,
     That we may learn to bear the beams of love
   And these black bodies and this sunburnt face
     Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove.
   \"For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear,
     The cloud will vanish, we shall hear His voice,
   Saying, 'Come out from the grove, my love and care
     And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice',\"
   Thus did my mother say, and kissed me;
   And thus I say to little English boy.
   When I from black and he from white cloud free,
   And round the tent of God like lambs we joy
   I'll shade him from the heat till he can bear
   To lean in joy upon our Father's knee;
   And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,
   And be like him, and he will then love me.
THE BLOSSOM

   Merry, merry sparrow!
   Under leaves so green
   A happy blossom
   Sees you, swift as arrow,
   Seek your cradle narrow,
   Near my bosom.
   Pretty, pretty robin!
   Under leaves so green
   A happy blossom
   Hears you sobbing, sobbing,
   Pretty, pretty robin,
   Near my bosom.
THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER

   When my mother died I was very young,
   And my father sold me while yet my tongue
   Could scarcely cry \"Weep! weep! weep! weep!\"
   So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.
   There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head,
   That curled like a lamb's back, was shaved; so I said,
   \"Hush, Tom! never mind it, for, when your head's bare,
   You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.\"
   And so he was quiet, and that very night,
   As Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight!—
   That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, and Jack,
   Were all of them locked up in coffins of black.
   And by came an angel, who had a bright key,
   And he opened the coffins, and let them all free;
   Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing, they run,
   And wash in a river, and shine in the sun.
   Then naked and white, all their bags left behind,
   They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind;
   And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy,
   He'd have God for his father, and never want joy.
   And so Tom awoke, and we rose in the dark,
   And got with our bags and our brushes to work.
   Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy and warm:
   So, if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.
THE LITTLE BOY LOST

   \"Father, father, where are you going?
     Oh do not walk so fast!
   Speak, father, speak to your little boy,
     Or else I shall be lost.\"
   The night was dark, no father was there,
     The child was wet with dew;
   The mire was deep, and the child did weep,
     And away the vapour flew.
THE LITTLE BOY FOUND

   The little boy lost in the lonely fen,
     Led by the wandering light,
   Began to cry, but God, ever nigh,
     Appeared like his father, in white.
   He kissed the child, and by the hand led,
     And to his mother brought,
   Who in sorrow pale, through the lonely dale,
     The little boy weeping sought.
LAUGHING SONG

   When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy,
   And the dimpling stream runs laughing by;
   When the air does laugh with our merry wit,
   And the green hill laughs with the noise of it;
   when the meadows laugh with lively green,
   And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene,
   When Mary and Susan and Emily
   With their sweet round mouths sing \"Ha, ha he!\"
   When the painted birds laugh in the shade,
   Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread:
   Come live, and be merry, and join with me,
   To sing the sweet chorus of \"Ha, ha, he!\"
A SONG

   Sweet dreams, form a shade
   O'er my lovely infant's head!
   Sweet dreams of pleasant streams
   By happy, silent, moony beams!
   Sweet Sleep, with soft down
   Weave thy brows an infant crown
   Sweet Sleep, angel mild,
   Hover o'er my happy child!
   Sweet smiles, in the night
   Hover over my delight!
   Sweet smiles, mother's smile,
   All the livelong night beguile.
   Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,
   Chase not slumber from thine eyes!
   Sweet moan, sweeter smile,
   All the dovelike moans beguile.
   Sleep, sleep, happy child!
   All creation slept and smiled.
   Sleep, sleep, happy sleep,
   While o'er thee doth mother weep.
   Sweet babe, in thy face
   Holy image I can trace;
   Sweet babe, once like thee
   Thy Maker lay, and wept for me:
   Wept for me, for thee, for all,
   When He was an infant small.
   Thou His image ever see,
   Heavenly face that smiles on thee!
   Smiles on thee, on me, on all,
   Who became an infant small;
   Infant smiles are his own smiles;
   Heaven and earth to peace beguiles.
DIVINE IMAGE

   To Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,
     All pray in their distress,
   And to these virtues of delight
     Return their thankfulness.
   For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,
     Is God our Father dear;
   And Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,
     Is man, his child and care.
   For Mercy has a human heart
     Pity, a human face;
   And Love, the human form divine;
     And Peace, the human dress.
   Then every man, of every clime,
     That prays in his distress,
   Prays to the human form divine:
     Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.
   And all must love the human form,
     In heathen, Turk, or Jew.
   Where Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell,
     There God is dwelling too.
HOLY THURSDAY

   'Twas on a Holy Thursday, their innocent faces clean,
   Came children walking two and two, in read, and blue, and green:
   Grey-headed beadles walked before, with wands as white as snow,
   Till into the high dome of Paul's they like Thames waters flow.
   Oh what a multitude they seemed, these flowers of London town!
   Seated in companies they sit, with radiance all their own.
   The hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs,
   Thousands of little boys and girls raising their innocent hands.
   Now like a mighty wild they raise to heaven the voice of song,
   Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among:
   Beneath them sit the aged man, wise guardians of the poor.
   Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door.
NIGHT

   The sun descending in the west,
   The evening star does shine;
   The birds are silent in their nest,
   And I must seek for mine.
     The moon, like a flower
     In heaven's high bower,
     With silent delight,
     Sits and smiles on the night.
   Farewell, green fields and happy grove,
   Where flocks have ta'en delight.
   Where lambs have nibbled, silent move
   The feet of angels bright;
     Unseen they pour blessing,
     And joy without ceasing,
     On each bud and blossom,
     And each sleeping bosom.
   They look in every thoughtless nest
   Where birds are covered warm;
   They visit caves of every beast,
   To keep them all from harm:
     If they see any weeping
     That should have been sleeping,
     They pour sleep on their head,
     And sit down by their bed.
   When wolves and tigers howl for prey,
   They pitying stand and weep;
   Seeking to drive their thirst away,
   And keep them from the sheep.
     But, if they rush dreadful,
     The angels, most heedful,
     Receive each mild spirit,
     New worlds to inherit.
   And there the lion's ruddy eyes
   Shall flow with tears of gold:
   And pitying the tender cries,
   And walking round the fold:
     Saying: \"Wrath by His meekness,
     And, by His health, sickness,
     Are driven away
     From our immortal day.
   \"And now beside thee, bleating lamb,
   I can lie down and sleep,
   Or think on Him who bore thy name,
   Graze after thee, and weep.
     For, washed in life's river,
     My bright mane for ever
     Shall shine like the gold,
     As I guard o'er the fold.\"
SPRING

        Sound the flute!
        Now it's mute!
        Bird's delight,
        Day and night,
        Nightingale,
        In the dale,
        Lark in sky,—
        Merrily,
   Merrily merrily, to welcome in the year.
        Little boy,
        Full of joy;
        Little girl,
        Sweet and small;
        Cock does crow,
        So do you;
        Merry voice,
        Infant noise;
   Merrily, merrily, to welcome in the year.
        Little lamb,
        Here I am;
        Come and lick
        My white neck;
        Let me pull
        Your soft wool;
        Let me kiss
        Your soft face;
   Merrily, merrily, to welcome in the year.
NURSE'S SONG

   When the voices of children are heard on the green,
     And laughing is heard on the hill,
   My heart is at rest within my breast,
     And everything else is still.
   \"Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,
     And the dews of night arise;
   Come, come, leave off play, and let us away,
     Till the morning appears in the skies.\"
   \"No, no, let us play, for it is yet day,
     And we cannot go to sleep;
   Besides, in the sky the little birds fly,
     And the hills are all covered with sheep.\"
   \"Well, well, go and play till the light fades away,
     And then go home to bed.\"
   The little ones leaped, and shouted, and laughed,
     And all the hills echoed.
INFANT JOY

   \"I have no name;
   I am but two days old.\"
   What shall I call thee?
   \"I happy am,
   Joy is my name.\"
   Sweet joy befall thee!
   Pretty joy!
   Sweet joy, but two days old.
   Sweet Joy I call thee:
   Thou dost smile,
   I sing the while;
   Sweet joy befall thee!
A DREAM

   Once a dream did weave a shade
   O'er my angel-guarded bed,
   That an emmet lost its way
   Where on grass methought I lay.
   Troubled, wildered, and forlorn,
   Dark, benighted, travel-worn,
   Over many a tangle spray,
   All heart-broke, I heard her say:
   \"Oh my children! do they cry,
   Do they hear their father sigh?
   Now they look abroad to see,
   Now return and weep for me.\"
   Pitying, I dropped a tear:
   But I saw a glow-worm near,
   Who replied, \"What wailing wight
   Calls the watchman of the night?
   \"I am set to light the ground,
   While the beetle goes his round:
   Follow now the beetle's hum;
   Little wanderer, hie thee home!\"
ON ANOTHER'S SORROW

   Can I see another's woe,
   And not be in sorrow too?
   Can I see another's grief,
   And not seek for kind relief?
   Can I see a falling tear,
   And not feel my sorrow's share?
   Can a father see his child
   Weep, nor be with sorrow filled?
   Can a mother sit and hear
   An infant groan, an infant fear?
   No, no! never can it be!
   Never, never can it be!
   And can He who smiles on all
   Hear the wren with sorrows small,
   Hear the small bird's grief and care,
   Hear the woes that infants bear—
   And not sit beside the next,
   Pouring pity in their breast,
   And not sit the cradle near,
   Weeping tear on infant's tear?
   And not sit both night and day,
   Wiping all our tears away?
   Oh no! never can it be!
   Never, never can it be!
   He doth give his joy to all:
   He becomes an infant small,
   He becomes a man of woe,
   He doth feel the sorrow too.
   Think not thou canst sigh a sigh,
   And thy Maker is not by:
   Think not thou canst weep a tear,
   And thy Maker is not near.
   Oh He gives to us his joy,
   That our grief He may destroy:
   Till our grief is fled an gone
   He doth sit by us and moan.
SONGS OF EXPERIENCE

INTRODUCTION

   Hear the voice of the Bard,
   Who present, past, and future, sees;
   Whose ears have heard
   The Holy Word
   That walked among the ancient tree;
   Calling the lapsed soul,
   And weeping in the evening dew;
   That might control
   The starry pole,
   And fallen, fallen light renew!
   \"O Earth, O Earth, return!
   Arise from out the dewy grass!
   Night is worn,
   And the morn
   Rises from the slumbrous mass.
   \"Turn away no more;
   Why wilt thou turn away?
   The starry floor,
   The watery shore,
   Are given thee till the break of day.\"
EARTH'S ANSWER

   Earth raised up her head
   From the darkness dread and drear,
   Her light fled,
   Stony, dread,
   And her locks covered with grey despair.
   \"Prisoned on watery shore,
   Starry jealousy does keep my den
   Cold and hoar;
   Weeping o'er,
   I hear the father of the ancient men.
   \"Selfish father of men!
   Cruel, jealous, selfish fear!
   Can delight,
   Chained in night,
   The virgins of youth and morning bear?
   \"Does spring hide its joy,
   When buds and blossoms grow?
   Does the sower
   Sow by night,
   Or the plowman in darkness plough?
   \"Break this heavy chain,
   That does freeze my bones around!
   Selfish, vain,
   Eternal bane,
   That free love with bondage bound.\"
THE CLOD AND THE PEBBLE

   \"Love seeketh not itself to please,
     Nor for itself hath any care,
   But for another gives it ease,
     And builds a heaven in hell's despair.\"
   So sang a little clod of clay,
     Trodden with the cattle's feet,
   But a pebble of the brook
     Warbled out these metres meet:
   \"Love seeketh only Self to please,
     To bind another to its delight,
   Joys in another's loss of ease,
     And builds a hell in heaven's despite.\"
HOLY THURSDAY

   Is this a holy thing to see
     In a rich and fruitful land,—
   Babes reduced to misery,
     Fed with cold and usurous hand?
   Is that trembling cry a song?
     Can it be a song of joy?
   And so many children poor?
     It is a land of poverty!
   And their son does never shine,
     And their fields are bleak and bare,
   And their ways are filled with thorns:
     It is eternal winter there.
   For where'er the sun does shine,
     And where'er the rain does fall,
   Babes should never hunger there,
     Nor poverty the mind appall.
THE LITTLE GIRL LOST

   In futurity
   I prophetic see
   That the earth from sleep
   (Grave the sentence deep)
   Shall arise, and seek
   for her Maker meek;
   And the desert wild
   Become a garden mild.
   In the southern clime,
   Where the summer's prime
   Never fades away,
   Lovely Lyca lay.
   Seven summers old
   Lovely Lyca told.
   She had wandered long,
   Hearing wild birds' song.
   \"Sweet sleep, come to me
   Underneath this tree;
   Do father, mother, weep?
   Where can Lyca sleep?
   \"Lost in desert wild
   Is your little child.
   How can Lyca sleep
   If her mother weep?
   \"If her heart does ache,
   Then let Lyca wake;
   If my mother sleep,
   Lyca shall not weep.
   \"Frowning, frowning night,
   O'er this desert bright
   Let thy moon arise,
   While I close my eyes.\"
   Sleeping Lyca lay
   While the beasts of prey,
   Come from caverns deep,
   Viewed the maid asleep.
   The kingly lion stood,
   And the virgin viewed:
   Then he gambolled round
   O'er the hallowed ground.
   Leopards, tigers, play
   Round her as she lay;
   While the lion old
   Bowed his mane of gold,
   And her breast did lick
   And upon her neck,
   From his eyes of flame,
   Ruby tears there came;
   While the lioness
   Loosed her slender dress,
   And naked they conveyed
   To caves the sleeping maid.
THE LITTLE GIRL FOUND

   All the night in woe
   Lyca's parents go
   Over valleys deep,
   While the deserts weep.
   Tired and woe-begone,
   Hoarse with making moan,
   Arm in arm, seven days
   They traced the desert ways.
   Seven nights they sleep
   Among shadows deep,
   And dream they see their child
   Starved in desert wild.
   Pale through pathless ways
   The fancied image strays,
   Famished, weeping, weak,
   With hollow piteous shriek.
   Rising from unrest,
   The trembling woman pressed
   With feet of weary woe;
   She could no further go.
   In his arms he bore
   Her, armed with sorrow sore;
   Till before their way
   A couching lion lay.
   Turning back was vain:
   Soon his heavy mane
   Bore them to the ground,
   Then he stalked around,
   Smelling to his prey;
   But their fears allay
   When he licks their hands,
   And silent by them stands.
   They look upon his eyes,
   Filled with deep surprise;
   And wondering behold
   A spirit armed in gold.
   On his head a crown,
   On his shoulders down
   Flowed his golden hair.
   Gone was all their care.
   \"Follow me,\" he said;
   \"Weep not for the maid;
   In my palace deep,
   Lyca lies asleep.\"
   Then they followed
   Where the vision led,
   And saw their sleeping child
   Among tigers wild.
   To this day they dwell
   In a lonely dell,
   Nor fear the wolvish howl
   Nor the lion's growl.
THE CHIMNEY SWEEPER

   A little black thing in the snow,
   Crying \"weep! weep!\" in notes of woe!
   \"Where are thy father and mother? Say!\"—
   \"They are both gone up to the church to pray.
   \"Because I was happy upon the heath,
   And smiled among the winter's snow,
   They clothed me in the clothes of death,
   And taught me to sing the notes of woe.
   \"And because I am happy and dance and sing,
   They think they have done me no injury,
   And are gone to praise God and his priest and king,
   Who make up a heaven of our misery.\"
NURSE'S SONG

   When voices of children are heard on the green,
   And whisperings are in the dale,
   The days of my youth rise fresh in my mind,
   My face turns green and pale.
   Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,
   And the dews of night arise;
   Your spring and your day are wasted in play,
   And your winter and night in disguise.
THE SICK ROSE

   O rose, thou art sick!
     The invisible worm,
   That flies in the night,
     In the howling storm,
   Has found out thy bed
     Of crimson joy,
   And his dark secret love
     Does thy life destroy.
THE FLY

   Little Fly,
   Thy summer's play
   My thoughtless hand
   Has brushed away.
   Am not I
   A fly like thee?
   Or art not thou
   A man like me?
   For I dance
   And drink, and sing,
   Till some blind hand
   Shall brush my wing.
   If thought is life
   And strength and breath
   And the want
   Of thought is death;
   Then am I
   A happy fly,
   If I live,
   Or if I die.
THE ANGEL

   I dreamt a dream! What can it mean?
   And that I was a maiden Queen
   Guarded by an Angel mild:
   Witless woe was ne'er beguiled!
   And I wept both night and day,
   And he wiped my tears away;
   And I wept both day and night,
   And hid from him my heart's delight.
   So he took his wings, and fled;
   Then the morn blushed rosy red.
   I dried my tears, and armed my fears
   With ten-thousand shields and spears.
   Soon my Angel came again;
   I was armed, he came in vain;
   For the time of youth was fled,
   And grey hairs were on my head.
THE TYGER

   Tyger, tyger, burning bright
   In the forests of the night,
   What immortal hand or eye
   Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
   In what distant deeps or skies
   Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
   On what wings dare he aspire?
   What the hand dare seize the fire?
   And what shoulder and what art
   Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
   And, when thy heart began to beat,
   What dread hand and what dread feet?
   What the hammer? what the chain?
   In what furnace was thy brain?
   What the anvil? what dread grasp
   Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
   When the stars threw down their spears,
   And watered heaven with their tears,
   Did he smile his work to see?
   Did he who made the lamb make thee?
   Tyger, tyger, burning bright
   In the forests of the night,
   What immortal hand or eye
   Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
MY PRETTY ROSE TREE

   A flower was offered to me,
     Such a flower as May never bore;
   But I said \"I've a pretty rose tree,\"
     And I passed the sweet flower o'er.
   Then I went to my pretty rose tree,
     To tend her by day and by night;
   But my rose turned away with jealousy,
     And her thorns were my only delight.
AH SUNFLOWER

   Ah Sunflower, weary of time,
     Who countest the steps of the sun;
   Seeking after that sweet golden clime
     Where the traveller's journey is done;
   Where the Youth pined away with desire,
     And the pale virgin shrouded in snow,
   Arise from their graves, and aspire
     Where my Sunflower wishes to go!
THE LILY

   The modest Rose puts forth a thorn,
   The humble sheep a threat'ning horn:
   While the Lily white shall in love delight,
   Nor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauty bright.
THE GARDEN OF LOVE

   I laid me down upon a bank,
     Where Love lay sleeping;
   I heard among the rushes dank
     Weeping, weeping.
   Then I went to the heath and the wild,
     To the thistles and thorns of the waste;
   And they told me how they were beguiled,
     Driven out, and compelled to the chaste.
   I went to the Garden of Love,
     And saw what I never had seen;
   A Chapel was built in the midst,
     Where I used to play on the green.
   And the gates of this Chapel were shut
     And \"Thou shalt not,\" writ over the door;
   So I turned to the Garden of Love
     That so many sweet flowers bore.
   And I saw it was filled with graves,
     And tombstones where flowers should be;
   And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,
     And binding with briars my joys and desires.
THE LITTLE VAGABOND

   Dear mother, dear mother, the Church is cold;
   But the Alehouse is healthy, and pleasant, and warm.
   Besides, I can tell where I am used well;
   The poor parsons with wind like a blown bladder swell.
   But, if at the Church they would give us some ale,
   And a pleasant fire our souls to regale,
   We'd sing and we'd pray all the livelong day,
   Nor ever once wish from the Church to stray.
   Then the Parson might preach, and drink, and sing,
   And we'd be as happy as birds in the spring;
   And modest Dame Lurch, who is always at church,
   Would not have bandy children, nor fasting, nor birch.
   And God, like a father, rejoicing to see
   His children as pleasant and happy as he,
   Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the barrel,
   But kiss him, and give him both drink and apparel.
LONDON

   I wandered through each chartered street,
     Near where the chartered Thames does flow,
   A mark in every face I meet,
     Marks of weakness, marks of woe.
   In every cry of every man,
     In every infant's cry of fear,
   In every voice, in every ban,
     The mind-forged manacles I hear:
   How the chimney-sweeper's cry
     Every blackening church appalls,
   And the hapless soldier's sigh
     Runs in blood down palace-walls.
   But most, through midnight streets I hear
     How the youthful harlot's curse
   Blasts the new-born infant's tear,
     And blights with plagues the marriage-hearse.
THE HUMAN ABSTRACT

   Pity would be no more
   If we did not make somebody poor,
   And Mercy no more could be
   If all were as happy as we.
   And mutual fear brings Peace,
   Till the selfish loves increase;
   Then Cruelty knits a snare,
   And spreads his baits with care.
   He sits down with his holy fears,
   And waters the ground with tears;
   Then Humility takes its root
   Underneath his foot.
   Soon spreads the dismal shade
   Of Mystery over his head,
   And the caterpillar and fly
   Feed on the Mystery.
   And it bears the fruit of Deceit,
   Ruddy and sweet to eat,
   And the raven his nest has made
   In its thickest shade.
   The gods of the earth and sea
   Sought through nature to find this tree,
   But their search was all in vain:
   There grows one in the human Brain.
INFANT SORROW

   My mother groaned, my father wept:
   Into the dangerous world I leapt,
   Helpless, naked, piping loud,
   Like a fiend hid in a cloud.
   Struggling in my father's hands,
   Striving against my swaddling-bands,
   Bound and weary, I thought best
   To sulk upon my mother's breast.
A POISON TREE

   I was angry with my friend:
   I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
   I was angry with my foe:
   I told it not, my wrath did grow.
   And I watered it in fears
   Night and morning with my tears,
   And I sunned it with smiles
   And with soft deceitful wiles.
   And it grew both day and night,
   Till it bore an apple bright,
   And my foe beheld it shine,
   and he knew that it was mine,—
   And into my garden stole
   When the night had veiled the pole;
   In the morning, glad, I see
   My foe outstretched beneath the tree.
A LITTLE BOY LOST

   \"Nought loves another as itself,
     Nor venerates another so,
   Nor is it possible to thought
     A greater than itself to know.
   \"And, father, how can I love you
     Or any of my brothers more?
   I love you like the little bird
     That picks up crumbs around the door.\"
   The Priest sat by and heard the child;
     In trembling zeal he seized his hair,
   He led him by his little coat,
     And all admired the priestly care.
   And standing on the altar high,
     \"Lo, what a fiend is here!\" said he:
   \"One who sets reason up for judge
     Of our most holy mystery.\"
   The weeping child could not be heard,
     The weeping parents wept in vain:
   They stripped him to his little shirt,
     And bound him in an iron chain,
   And burned him in a holy place
     Where many had been burned before;
   The weeping parents wept in vain.
     Are such thing done on Albion's shore?
A LITTLE GIRL LOST

   Children of the future age,
   Reading this indignant page,
   Know that in a former time
   Love, sweet love, was thought a crime.
   In the age of gold,
   Free from winter's cold,
   Youth and maiden bright,
   To the holy light,
   Naked in the sunny beams delight.
   Once a youthful pair,
   Filled with softest care,
   Met in garden bright
   Where the holy light
   Had just removed the curtains of the night.
   Then, in rising day,
   On the grass they play;
   Parents were afar,
   Strangers came not near,
   And the maiden soon forgot her fear.
   Tired with kisses sweet,
   They agree to meet
   When the silent sleep
   Waves o'er heaven's deep,
   And the weary tired wanderers weep.
   To her father white
   Came the maiden bright;
   But his loving look,
   Like the holy book
   All her tender limbs with terror shook.
   \"Ona, pale and weak,
   To thy father speak!
   Oh the trembling fear!
   Oh the dismal care
   That shakes the blossoms of my hoary hair!\"
THE SCHOOLBOY

   I love to rise on a summer morn,
     When birds are singing on every tree;
   The distant huntsman winds his horn,
     And the skylark sings with me:
     Oh what sweet company!
   But to go to school in a summer morn,—
     Oh it drives all joy away!
   Under a cruel eye outworn,
     The little ones spend the day
     In sighing and dismay.
   Ah then at times I drooping sit,
     And spend many an anxious hour;
   Nor in my book can I take delight,
     Nor sit in learning's bower,
     Worn through with the dreary shower.
   How can the bird that is born for joy
     Sit in a cage and sing?
   How can a child, when fears annoy,
     But droop his tender wing,
     And forget his youthful spring?
   Oh father and mother, if buds are nipped,
     And blossoms blown away;
   And if the tender plants are stripped
     Of their joy in the springing day,
     By sorrow and care's dismay,—
   How shall the summer arise in joy,
     Or the summer fruits appear?
   Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy,
     Or bless the mellowing year,
     When the blasts of winter appear?
TO TIRZAH

   Whate'er is born of mortal birth
   Must be consumed with the earth,
   To rise from generation free:
   Then what have I to do with thee?
   The sexes sprang from shame and pride,
   Blown in the morn, in evening died;
   But mercy changed death into sleep;
   The sexes rose to work and weep.
   Thou, mother of my mortal part,
   With cruelty didst mould my heart,
   And with false self-deceiving tears
   Didst bind my nostrils, eyes, and ears,
   Didst close my tongue in senseless clay,
   And me to mortal life betray.
   The death of Jesus set me free:
   Then what have I to do with thee?
THE VOICE OF THE ANCIENT BARD

   Youth of delight! come hither
   And see the opening morn,
   Image of Truth new-born.
   Doubt is fled, and clouds of reason,
   Dark disputes and artful teazing.
   Folly is an endless maze;
   Tangled roots perplex her ways;
   How many have fallen there!
   They stumble all night over bones of the dead;
   And feel—they know not what but care;
   And wish to lead others, when they should be led.
APPENDIX

A DIVINE IMAGE

   Cruelty has a human heart,
     And Jealousy a human face;
   Terror the human form divine,
     And Secresy the human dress.
   The human dress is forged iron,
     The human form a fiery forge,
   The human face a furnace sealed,
     The human heart its hungry gorge.
   NOTE: Though written and engraved by Blake, \"A DIVINE IMAGE\" was
   never included in the SONGS OF INNOCENCE AND OF EXPERIENCE.

THEL'S Motto

  Does the Eagle know what is in the pit?
  Or wilt thou go ask the Mole:
  Can Wisdom be put in a silver rod?
  Or Love in a golden bowl?
THE BOOK of THEL

THEL

I

  The daughters of Mne Seraphim led round their sunny flocks,
  All but the youngest: she in paleness sought the secret air.
  To fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day:
  Down by the river of Adona her soft voice is heard;
  And thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew.
  O life of this our spring! why fades the lotus of the water?
  Why fade these children of the spring? born but to smile & fall.
  Ah! Thel is like a watry bow, and like a parting cloud,
  Like a reflection in a glass: like shadows in the water
  Like dreams of infants, like a smile upon an infants face.
  Like the doves voice, like transient day, like music in the air:
  Ah! gentle may I lay me down and gentle rest my head.
  And gentle sleep the sleep of death, and gently hear the voice
  Of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time.
  The Lilly of the valley breathing in the humble grass
  Answerd the lovely maid and said: I am a watry weed,
  And I am very small and love to dwell in lowly vales:
  So weak the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head
  Yet I am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all
  Walks in the valley, and each morn over me spreads his hand
  Saying, rejoice thou humble grass, thou new-born lily flower.
  Thou gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest brooks:
  For thou shall be clothed in light, and fed with morning manna:
  Till summers heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs
  To flourish in eternal vales: they why should Thel complain.
  Why should the mistress of the vales of Har, utter a sigh.
She ceasd & smild in tears, then sat down in her silver shrine.

  Thel answerd, O thou little virgin of the peaceful valley.
  Giving to those that cannot crave, the voiceless, the o'er tired
  The breath doth nourish the innocent lamb, he smells the milky garments
  He crops thy flowers while thou sittest smiling in his face,
  Wiping his mild and meekin mouth from all contagious taints.
  Thy wine doth purify the golden honey; thy perfume.
  Which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs
  Revives the milked cow, & tames the fire-breathing steed.
  But Thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun:
  I vanish from my pearly throne, and who shall find my place.
  Queen of the vales the Lily answered, ask the tender cloud,
  And it shall tell thee why it glitters in the morning sky.
  And why it scatters its bright beauty thro the humid air.
  Descend O little cloud & hover before the eyes of Thel.
  The Cloud descended and the Lily bowd her modest head:
  And went to mind her numerous charge among the verdant grass.
II.

  O little Cloud the virgin said, I charge thee to tell me
  Why thou complainest now when in one hour thou fade away:
  Then we shall seek thee but not find: ah Thel is like to thee.
  I pass away, yet I complain, and no one hears my voice.
  The Cloud then shewd his golden head & his bright form emerg'd.
  Hovering and glittering on the air before the face of Thel.
  O virgin know'st thou not our steeds drink of the golden springs
  Where Luvah doth renew his horses: lookst thou on my youth.
  And fearest thou because I vanish and am seen no more.
  Nothing remains; O maid I tell thee, when I pass away.
  It is to tenfold life, to love, to peace, and raptures holy:
  Unseen descending, weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers:
  And court the fair eyed dew, to take me to her shining tent
  The weeping virgin, trembling kneels before the risen sun.
  Till we arise link'd in a golden band and never part:
  But walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers.
  Dost thou O little cloud? I fear that I am not like thee:
  For I walk through the vales of Har, and smell the sweetest flowers:
  But I feed not the little flowers: I hear the warbling birds,
  But I feed not the warbling birds, they fly and seek their food:
  But Thel delights in these no more because I fade away
  And all shall say, without a use this shining women liv'd,
  Or did she only live to be at death the food of worms.
The Cloud reclind upon his airy throne and answerd thus.

  Then if thou art the food of worms, O virgin of the skies,
  How great thy use, how great thy blessing, every thing that lives.
  Lives not alone nor or itself: fear not and I will call,
  The weak worm from its lowly bed, and thou shalt hear its voice.
  Come forth worm and the silent valley, to thy pensive queen.
  The helpless worm arose and sat upon the Lillys leaf,
  And the bright Cloud saild on, to find his partner in the vale.
III.

Then Thel astonish'd view'd the Worm upon its dewy bed.

  Art thou a Worm? image of weakness, art thou but a Worm?
  I see thee like an infant wrapped in the Lillys leaf;
  Ah weep not little voice, thou can'st not speak, but thou can'st weep:
  Is this a Worm? I see they lay helpless & naked: weeping
  And none to answer, none to cherish thee with mothers smiles.
  The Clod of Clay heard the Worms voice & rais'd her pitying head:
  She bowd over the weeping infant, and her life exhald
  In milky fondness, then on Thel she fix'd her humble eyes;
  O beauty of the vales of Har, we live not for ourselves,
  Thou seest me the meanest thing, and so I am indeed:
  My bosom of itself is cold, and of itself is dark,
  But he that loves the lowly, pours his oil upon my head
  And kisses me, and binds his nuptial bands around my breast.
  And says; Thou mother of my children, I have loved thee
  And I have given thee a crown that none can take away.
  But how this is sweet maid, I know not, and I cannot know
  I ponder, and I cannot ponder; yet I live and love.
  The daughter of beauty wip'd her pitying tears with her white veil,
  And said, Alas! I knew not this, and therefore did I weep:
  That God would love a Worm I knew, and punish the evil foot
  That wilful bruis'd its helpless form: but that he cherish'd it
  With milk and oil I never knew, and therefore did I weep,
  And I complaind in the mild air, because I fade away.
  And lay me down in thy cold bed, and leave my shining lot.
  Queen of the vales, the matron Clay answered: I heard thy sighs.
  And all thy moans flew o'er my roof, but I have call'd them down:
  Wilt thou O Queen enter my house, tis given thee to enter,
  And to return: fear nothing, enter with thy virgin feet.
IV.

  The eternal gates terrific porter lifted the northern bar:
  Thel enter'd in & saw the secrets of the land unknown;
  She saw the couches of the dead, & where the fibrous roots
  Of every heart on earth infixes deep its restless twists:
  A land of sorrows & of tears where never smile was seen.
  She wandered in the land of clouds thro' valleys dark, listning
  Dolors & lamentations: waiting oft beside the dewy grave
  She stood in silence, listning to the voices of the ground,
  Till to her own grave plot she came, & there she sat down.
  And heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit.
  Why cannot the Ear be closed to its own destruction?
  Or the glistening Eye to the poison of a smile!
  Why are Eyelids stord with arrows ready drawn,
  Where a thousand fighting men in ambush lie!
  Or an Eye of gifts & graces showring fruits & coined gold!
  Why a Tongue impress'd with honey from every wind?
  Why an Ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in?
  Why a Nostril wide inhaling terror trembling & affright
  Why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy?
  Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?
  The Virgin started from her seat, & with a shriek,
  Fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of Har."""
